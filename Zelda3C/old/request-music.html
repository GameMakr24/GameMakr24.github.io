<h2><font color=gold>Zelda 3 Challenge - Music Requests!</font></h2>

I realize most people won't be able to help with this part of the game, but I know a few people who are great with handling SNES music.  Hyrule Magic allows the insertion of new music, replacing old songs, but it can be very difficult and confusing, especially for someone with no background in music.  I have one person who has already provided new music for the game, but because he's so busy, I'm requesting help from anyone else who might be able to transpose music.<br><br>

<hr><p>

<font color=gold>
<b>Rules:</b><p>
</font>

<font color=gold><b>
1.) </font></b>
<a href="mailto:zack76@juno.com">Contact me</a> before you get started.  Depending on what music you're transposing, I do have guidelines and plans for how they should sound.  You shouldn't waste your efforts on something that can't be used.  Plus, many songs in the game will be used in places where they didn't originaly play.  Always email me for specific information.<p>

<font color=gold><b>
2.) </font></b>
All submitted music must be usable in the actual game!  A remixed MP3 may be awesome, but it just won't work in Zelda3C.  The best method, as far as I know, is to start by creating new music in MIDI format. From there, the music must be inserted into the ROM via Hyrule Magic.  Patches for the ROM are necessary for this kind of request.  If I get a MIDI or MP3, I might still use it as a guideline or inspiration.<p>

<font color=gold><b>
3.) </font></b>
Music can be lifted from any other SNES game (or even NES) and submitted with whatever changes are necessary.  You can even start with other games' music, change it a lot, and then submit it.  <font color="red">Do NOT take music from any other hack, period.</font>  Don't submit music that you might use for your own purposes later.  Please don't take music from Zelda Classic or other current sources.<p>

<font color=gold><b>
4.) </font></b>
If an entry is accepted for use in Zelda3C, it will either be used as-is, or changed to work better in the game.  If the changes are considered major, the musician will be notified first.<p>  

<font color=gold><b>
5.) </font></b>
Valid entries are patches of ROMs which contain new music.  <b>Do NOT send me any ROMs!</b>  I will automatically delete any ROMs that are sent to me. I will not view them, nor save them to my computer.<p>

<b>Requests:</b><p>
</font>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Title Song:</b> I haven't thought of a specific song to use here.  I would like something which is a cross between the title songs of Zelda 2 and Chrono Trigger, but I'm very open to suggestions.<p>

World Map: [Already replaced!]<p>

Beginning: [Already replaced!]<p>

Rabbit: This song isn't too important to change, especially since I have no idea what I'd like to use.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Forest:</b> There is no forest song in Zelda3C.  Instead, I need a tropical paradise song for the beach areas.<p>

Intro: [Same, until further notice.]<p>

Town: [Already replaced!]<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Warp:</b> This should be the music played in Zelda64 for the Ocarina of Time.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Dark World:</b> This is an exciting song.  To prevent spoilers, my idea for its replacement won't be posted.<p>

Master Swd: [Same, but open to suggestions.]<p>

File Select: [Same]<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Soldier:</b> This could be the moblin song of Zelda 4...<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Mountain:</b> This is a serious song.  To prevent spoilers, my idea for its replacement won't be posted.<p>

Shop: [Same, but open to suggestions.]<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Fanfare:</b> [See Title Song, above]<p>

Castle: [Already replaced!]<p>

Dungeon: [Already replaced!][Needs improvement in one area.]<p>

Secret Way: [Already replaced!]<p>

Rescue: [Same]<p>

Crystal: [Same, but open to suggestions.]<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> <b>Fountain:</b> It might be good to use the fairy song from Zelda 4.<p>

Kill Agah: This song represented Agahnim becoming Ganon.  Not sure what I'd like to use, yet.<p>
