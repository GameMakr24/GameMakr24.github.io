<h2><font color=gold>Zelda 3 Challenge - ASM Hack Requests!</font></h2>

I've planned most of the game around the idea that these requests will not be fullfilled.  However, the game will be so much better if anyone can write code to handle the situations listed below.  Most are overworld entrance events; I realize they are complicated and difficult to work with.  (There are already several ASM hacks in Zelda3C, but I won't reveal them unless they conflict with upcoming solutions.)<br><br>

<b>Requests:</b><p>
</font>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Quake Medallion (Importance: HIGH) - This event originally opened Turtle Rock in Zelda 3.  I need to move this event to a different screen, with the same result occuring when Link uses the medallion in the right place.  A different set of graphics is used, but the overlay can be based on these graphics.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Fire Rod (Importance: Medium) - This event originally opened the final entrance of Skull Forest in Zelda 3.  I need to move this event to a different screen, with the same result occuring when Link uses the fire rod in the right place.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Ether Medallion (Importance: Medium) - This event originally opened Misery Mire in Zelda 3.  I need to move this event to a different screen, with the same result occuring when Link uses the medallion in the right place.  There is no background rain to remove here, but the event should otherwise work the same way.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Kiki the Monkey (Importance: HIGH) - This event originally opened the Dark Palace in Zelda 3.  I need to move this event to a different screen, with the same result occuring when Kiki is paid money in the right place.  I already have the data required to move the points where Kiki talks; only the actual event needs to be moved.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Pound 3 Pegs (Importance: Low) - This event originally revealed a warp tile which granted access to the top of Turtle Rock in Zelda 3.  I need to move this event to a different screen, with the same result occuring when Link pounds three pegs in the right order.<p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Boss Hearts (Importance: HIGH) - I would like every boss which holds a pendant or crystal to drop a heart piece instead of a heart container.  When the heart piece is collected, the treasure then falls into the room.  <b>Someone has already begun work on this one; please contact me before getting started.</b><p>

<img src="mini-tri.gif"> Surprise ASM (Importance: N/A) - Lots of cool tricks can occur by creating small ASM hacks, many of which I'm not even aware.  If you can implement any great ASM hacks, I would be very grateful for your help.<p>
