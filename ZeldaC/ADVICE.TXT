**** Hints and Reminders, by ChibiDelenn ****

Here are some hints that will help you get through ZeldaC:

1) Have Tree, Will Burn.

2) If a wall or a cliff looks too blank, try making some holes in them.

3) For the above, the emulator's Freeze/Defrost is Your Friend.

4) Caught between a Rock and a hard place? "Push" your way out of it.

5) Ocarina + Warp Stairways = Time Saver. Learn the Map.

6) If something in a dungeon seems inaccessible even after you've completed all/most of the       level, then you forgot to Push, Bomb, or Kill everything in every room. 
Time to backtrack.

7) Regarding the above, Level 6's "Inaccessible" Keys aren't.

8) Level 7 DOES have a special Item. If you're stuck, refer to #6.

9) In the first half of Quest 1, you'll learn the art of Level Skipping and Level Hopping.

10) Unless you feel like repeating most of a (usually) hard level, DON'T use the 2nd player "Pause and Save/Continue" trick when feeding the hungry Molblins. It's not worth it.

11) Try to keep 100 rupees or more when entering a given dungeon. Trust me, it will save you some headaches later.

12) Always keep spare bombs handy inside dungeons. If you can't use your sword and you have no bombs, you're as good as Molblin Bait.

13) Walls aren't always walls. Trees aren't always trees. And sometimes, rocks aren't as solid as you might think. (Refer to #6)

14) If at first you don't succeed...

15) DON'T THROW THE CONTROLLER AT THE WALL. Patience is a Virtue.
