  to QuestForCalatia.net!</b><br>
  <br>
  Once upon a time, there was a great website known as Challenge Games. It was
  devoted to creating challenging new versions of classic games, releasing such
  treasures as Super Mario 3 Challenge and Zelda Challenge. It held the promise
  of many other adventures, but sadly, most of the group's members moved on to
  other things. The message board grew quiet and the site's hosting was not
  renewed; the CG community vanished, its visitors gathering elsewhere. <br>
  <br>
  While this location is not Challenge Games, it represents the spirit that
  made it great. This is the home of ZeldaC and my ongoing project, Zelda3C.
  This site will never aspire to replacing the original website's content; my
  only focus remains on developing the world of Calatia. <br>
  <br>
  Special thanks goes to Ryan for providing hosting for this project.<br>

  Every few weeks (or months, or longer), I post my latest progress in an
  online diary. Sometimes its purpose is to get feedback from future players,
  while other times it is written for my own benefit, to look back on later.
  Here you can see which part of the game I'm currently working on, read about
  what problems I'm tackling, and respond to the game's direction. You may pick
  up some hints about the game's content, but I'm careful about not releasing
  spoilers. <br>

  <br>
  Three years after leaving home, Link's quests have taken him to <a
  href="images/hyrule-map.jpg">all parts of Hyrule</a>, from the depths of the
  Lost Woods to the peaks of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Death</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
  w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType>, and from <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">North</st1:PlaceName>
  <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType>'s territory to the cursed
  valley of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Great</st1:PlaceName>
   <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Palace</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. He has
  journeyed to distant kingdoms, even to the eastern realm of the Outlands, all
  to keep peace in the world and protect the omnipotent Triforce. <br>
  <br>
  In all this time, he has not returned to his homeland, Calatia, where he was
  born and raised. Convinced that this kingdom held nothing of the splendor of
  Hyrule and other foreign lands, he had hurried away as a youth, unaware of
  the wonders he would someday uncover. He would never have guessed that the
  town's dysfunctional clock tower holds overwhelming powers of time travel.
  Nor could he suspect there were cryptic labyrinths entombed beneath this
  peaceful kingdom, with an ancient evil destined to grant them life. <br>
  <br>
  The beautiful <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">land</st1:PlaceType>
   of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Calatia</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> has a long
  history of peace and prosperity, lasting even through Hyrule's darkest ages.
  A day soon approaches, however, when Calatia will experience a series of
  disasters that will rip the kingdom apart. Time itself will bend to the will
  of a mysterious, avenging sorceress. Link will learn the truth about the
  lands he overlooked, but during a time when only the forgotten past can change
  the desolate future. <br>
  <br>
  (The name 'Calatia' is taken from old Zelda comic books, published by Valiant
  &amp; endorsed by Nintendo. This new version of Zelda 3 is, of course, NOT
  endorsed by Nintendo in any way.) <br>
  <br>
  <a href="story.txt">Zelda3C's opening story</a> is available for additional
  reading. It begins with an account of the Legend of Zelda, but for good
  reason. Although it contains spoilers about the game's beginning, not
  everything is revealed. It has been updated as of November 2013 to match
  Nintendo&#8217;s Zelda series timeline. Events leading up to Link's quest for
  Calatia are described in detail. <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <br>
  Calatia rests high in the mountains, split into various sections by cliffs
  and jagged terrain. The largest town, Meridia, is bordered by <st1:PlaceName
  w:st="on">Harmony</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Forest</st1:PlaceType>
  to the north, <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Death</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
  w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType> to the south, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
   w:st="on">Calatia</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
  on its western side and Kingdom Caverns to the east. A large river passes
  through this beautiful settlement, forming a great waterfall that is said to
  spill over the edge of the world. Little else is known of Calatia, for the
  wild country beyond civilization is guarded by natural pitfalls and malicious
  forces. <br>
  <br>
  Beneath the kingdom's awe-inspiring landscape lie the unexplored chambers of
  Calatia's dungeons. Enigmatic and cryptic, these secret labyrinths are
  inactive systems of death traps and fortresses. It is said that Ganon himself
  designed and created each stronghold, then mysteriously sealed them away
  without granting them any purpose. Popular lore places one in the forest,
  though it hasn&#8217;t been proven. Another is believed to be within the
  mines, but this entrance may only be a gateway to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
   w:st="on">Death</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=32 height=32 id="_x0000_i1033" src=mini-tree.gif><a
  name=plans><b>Plans &amp; Progress</b></a> <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1034" src=mini-tri.gif>The
  overworld is currently being designed from scratch at the tile level, using
  both new and existing combinations. Specific blocks will be altered to build
  major structures and unique locations. For example, Sanctuary and the Witch's
  Hut were spent in the creation of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Epoch</st1:PlaceName>
   <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Not counting
  repeated screens, there are 70 Light World areas and 64 Dark World areas.
  With my own search engine based on each of thousands of blocks I've carefully
  documented, this task isn't nearly as difficult, although it's still very
  time consuming. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1035" src=mini-tri.gif>Every
  dungeon will be a new creation, with original mazes and puzzles, new colors
  and graphics, and assortments of terror you've never faced before.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>There is plenty of room for
  exploration, as there are 296 rooms to set up. (12 dungeons, plus houses and
  caverns.) With full control over the indoor objects and room structures, I
  can be far more creative than with ZeldaC. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1036" src=mini-tri.gif>The text
  will be completely rewritten. Every word of it. Intro storyboard, signs,
  people, and events. 297 messages, formatted carefully to present essential
  clues, story and information. As it stands now, 75% of Zelda3C's text is
  already written. My writing style is different from Zelda 3 -- every other
  person won't be calling you 'brother' -- but it fits the new quest well. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1037" src=mini-tri.gif>While the
  frame of the original story (pendant &amp; crystals in light and dark worlds)
  cannot bend much, I've been creative to ensure that the new story is original
  and unique. Using time tiles and a legendary ocarina, Link must traverse the
  past and undo a terrible future. The story's volume is similar to the
  original game, limited only by text space and the number of events. The story
  itself is justly inspired by Zelda comics from NES days, which weren't very
  old when Zelda 3 was released. Characters, events, and settings remain true
  to both the comics and to the Zelda lore of that era, yet joined by
  references to newer titles. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1038" src=mini-tri.gif>Most of the
  music will be new or significantly altered. (27 songs total)<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve been in touch with four
  different musicians who would like to compose for the game, two of whom are
  familiar with Hyrule Magic&#8217;s music editor.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In the past, I&#8217;ve stated I would
  like to include some tracks from non-Zelda games, but I have since thought
  better of it; all will either be remixes of existing Zelda songs, or entirely
  new pieces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

  style='font-family:Arial'>A few of the songs are already written, by a
  musician whose name I cannot yet disclose. Which songs, so far? Overworld,
  Village, Cavern, Sanctuary, Castle, Palace. They each sound amazingly
  beautiful &#8211; I&#8217;m always tempted to spoil them by posting them as
  mp3s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Sorry, no Ocarina of Time
  &#8220;Lost Woods&#8221; theme... aren't you guys tired of that one yet?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'><span
  style='font-family:Arial'><br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1039" src=mini-tri.gif>The
  graphics are getting an overhaul, not just for a new look, but to represent
  new buildings and locations. Items, monsters, people, places, things --
  almost everything is changing in appearance. Some graphics will be original
  art, while more common things may be taken from other games.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>No man is an island, especially in a
  project this big, so I have enlisted the help of Josh N. and DarkPrince909 to
  create much of these graphics.<br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1040" src=mini-tri.gif>The
  palettes won't be changed very much, except where major graphics editing
  requires it. <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Calatia</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
  w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType>, for example, has grey stone colors instead
  of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hyrule</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
   w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>'s white, green and blue. Link
  is definitely wearing a better shade of green, with NO pink hair! The future
  world won't have ugly green water and yellowed earth, as that would be too
  similar to the Dark World. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1041" src=mini-tri.gif>The title
  screen will display a panoramic view of much of the kingdom, possibly with <st1:place
  w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Epoch</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
   w:st="on">Tower</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> (aka The Tower of Time) standing
  tall on one side. There will be no Master Sword sliding into the
  &#8216;Z&#8217;&#8230; something else appears instead.<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>;)<span
  style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>New storyboards will chronicle
  Calatia's past and preface the new opening story. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1042" src=mini-tri.gif>New 3D
  shapes! The golden Triforce has taken a pyramid shape, while the seven
  crystals become shards of the Triforce of Wisdom. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1043" src=mini-tri.gif>Two
  overworld maps (viewed by pushing X) will reveal Calatia as it appeared in
  the past and how it looks in the bleak future. Each of the 14 new dungeons
  will have new maps as well. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1044" src=mini-tri.gif>The
  game's ending will be different, simply because the sprites and locations
  themselves are different. The basic format, however, will likely be the same.
  The ending credits will list everyone who contributed ideas used in the game,
  as well as programmers and artists whom I depend on to make this game a
  reality. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1045" src=mini-tri.gif>Many more
  changes are in place, some of which required ASM hacking. These surprises
  won't be listed here, even after release. It will be up to you to discover
  them as you play the game... If you would like to help with ASM hacking, see
  the <a href="request-ASM.html">ASM Request</a> page. <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1046" src=mini-tri.gif>Extras
  (outside the ROM patch) will likely be the same as with ZeldaC -- HTML
  instruction manual, colorful world map, punching puppet Ganon, bonus soundtrack
  CD... (hey, nevermind the last two!) <br>
  <br>
  <img border=0 width=11 height=11 id="_x0000_i1047" src=mini-tri.gif>Quest
  design tactics will often be similar to ZeldaC. (Let's go back to Level 1 for
  that important item...) (Where in blazes is Level 6?) Each item will become
  more important, especially the boots, hookshot, the staff of Byrna, and the
  hammer. There will be many more monsters, placed in dire locations. You will
  get very lost, put forth real effort to uncover dungeon entrances, and get
  slammed by most every boss you meet. The clues you read will be essential. I
  still enjoy implementing one-way doors, HIDDEN cave entrances,
  &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;unreachable&quot; items, false walls, mandatory
  shortcuts, and surprise enemies. Beware. <br>

  name=wait><b>The Wait</b></a> <br>
  <br>
  It's been as difficult for me as it has for most of you. Every day I'm
  anxious to work on Zelda3C, yet every day I have to battle real life to get
  some free time. Progress continues, yet it's still impossible to estimate how
  long it will take to be finalized. One positive thing about this wait is that
  it's <i>finite</i>. I'm just as psyched about this game as I was years ago,
  moreso because of the progress I've made and the awesome concepts I've
  already set in motion. I have several years invested into this project, and I
  know I'll never lose interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>There's a LOT involved in completely rewriting this
  game. I'm not just orchestrating a new adventure, but re-commanding elements
  of the game that have never mixed this way before. There's so much to *know*,
  about both Hyrule Magic and the way the game operates. Much of my time has
  been spent simply studying things in the game as they interact, writing
  programs to work concurrently with Hyrule Magic, and struggling over the fine
  details of the overworld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>I walk around with my head in the clouds most days,
  when not actually working on the game, thinking of what I'll do next or how certain
  situations might play out. You wouldn't believe how many post-it notes,
  napkins and receipts I've had to write on while away from home, only to
  transcribe them later! I long to work on the game all week long, yet real
  life prevents solid progress outside of weekends. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>I'm much more likely to release screen shots and
  progress reports than any kind of beta. This is because I don't like people
  playing half-created masterpieces -- it's so much better to present
  everything 'fresh' at the same time. You don't really want to get deep into
  the adventure, only to stop after a few dungeons, do you? Of everything you
  see, you might ask yourself, &quot;Is that final?&quot; or &quot;Is this
  going to be better?&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
  <p style='tab-stops:45.8pt 91.6pt 137.4pt 183.2pt 229.0pt 274.8pt 320.6pt 366.4pt 412.2pt 458.0pt 503.8pt 549.6pt 595.4pt 641.2pt 687.0pt 732.8pt'><span
  style='font-family:Arial'>I know it's a long time to wait, but I insist on
  keeping the &quot;start-to-finish&quot; experience intact. This is exactly
  how I handled Zelda Challenge: Outlands. I made sure the wait was worth it,
  and people were thrilled to be presented with one complete game. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
