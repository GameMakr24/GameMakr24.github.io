The Legend of Zelda

According to Hylian history, the Evil King Ganon ultimately returned to Hyrule after 
generations of otherworldly exile.  He immediately stole the Triforce of Power from
Hyrule's royal family, claiming it as his own.  Princess Zelda, fearing for the 
safety of the entire kingdom, split her Triforce of Wisdom into 8 fragments and hid 
them throughout the land.  Ganon captured Zelda, imprisoning her in his 
Death Mountain lair, while hoards of his minions sought to kill any others that 
would stand in his way.

A boy named Link, at the age of fifteen, journeyed from his homeland of Calatia in 
search of adventure.  Knowing little of the world beyond his kingdom, he traveled 
wherever his feet would take him.  One fateful morning in a forest of Hyrule, he 
encountered a group of moblins terrorizing an old nursemaid.  After quickly 
vanquishing the beasts, Link learned that this elderly lady, called Impa, was 
desperately seeking aid from anyone who might be able to save Zelda and the kingdom 
of Hyrule.  Link felt concern in his heart for this conquered realm and resolved 
to slay Ganon at any risk.

Knowing that Ganon held the Triforce of Power, Link set out to reconstruct the 
Triforce of Wisdom.  After scouring the entire kingdom and combing the underworld, 
he fought and destroyed Ganon, the magical tyrant who had haunted this kingdom 
for generations.  With the triforces of Power and Wisdom secure, Link and Zelda 
worked to restore the lands he had explored and come to love.



The Adventure of Link

One day, as Link was nearing his sixteenth birthday, he discovered the symbol of 
the Triforce on the back of his left hand.  He thus learned from Impa that only he
could claim the Triforce of Courage, which was hidden long ago.  A princess named 
Zelda from ancient times, put magically to sleep for refusing to speak of its 
location, could only be awakened by using the three triforces together.  

Link set off on another quest, placing crystals into palace statues to undo the 
binding force surrounding the Great Palace.  Overcoming the trials which sealed it 
away, he finally earned the Triforce of Courage.



An Alternate Ending

The Legend of Zelda is the story of a princess who defied Ganon, and of a boy 
who united the Triforce, rescued the princess and brought peace to Hyrule...  

But what if none of these events ever took place?  What if the strands of time 
were torn, such that Link never set out on his adventure, leaving Calatia and
encountering Impa in Hyrule?  Could Ganon have conquered the entire world, 
fulfilling his evil wish from ages past?  Without Link's heroism, Ganon could have 
collected Zelda's hidden Triforce pieces and coupled Wisdom with the Triforce of 
Power, granting him the unrivaled power to rule the cosmos.

Was Link a hero by fate, or by chance?



Prelude to Calatia

It has been over three years since the death of Ganon.  Link has experienced many 
adventures during this time, in the service of protecting Hyrule, its people, and the 
royal family.  At eighteen years of age, he has reached maturity and is well-respected 
and loved as a hero and friend to all.  Prosperity abounds and the world has embraced peace.

One wintry night an urgent message reached the gates of Hyrule Castle.  Princess Zelda 
had been summoned by Queen Seline, the ruler of the kingdom of Calatia.  The monarchy
was in great distress and the circumstances required the Triforce of Wisdom for guidance.  
Racing away from Hyrule on horseback, Link accompanied Zelda to Death Mountain's cavern 
entrance near the town of Saria, which leads west into Calatia.  

As they rounded the last bend within Kingdom Caverns, the air burst around them
and Link was hurled high against the wall by an unknown force.  Magical bindings
held him in place, and as he looked down, he could see Zelda calmly collecting
his sword and shield from the ground.

"Yes, I have the Triforce of Wisdom", she said in an a slow, even tone.  
"I will go where you command.  I hear, and I obey."

In a hypnotized trance, Zelda walked into a tunnel which branched away from the main exit.
The Triforce of Wisdom floated ominously beside her.  As the magic around him faded,
Link broke free, fell to the ground and chased after her.  But he was too late -- a large
stone door had fallen into place before he could save her.

Link hurried outside of Kingdom Caverns, only to find his hometown of Meridia under seige
by an army of moblins.  He rushed into the chaos with no weapon and no information.

Eventually, Link learned that an evil sorceress had carried the Triforce of Wisdom to
the top of Epoch Tower, a large clock tower to the north.  He hurriedly began to climb the 
tower, knowing that the sorceress was preparing a portal to another time...



Quest for Calatia

By entering the gate atop Epoch Tower, Link has traveled back in time ten years.
The sorceress, in spite of being followed, has vowed to kill the younger, 
eight year-old Link who would someday overthrow Ganon.  However, the Kingdom
of Calatia is vast; she cannot hope to discover the whereabouts of young Link.  
In a crazed effort to save Ganon's future, she will use her powers to wreck havoc on 
Calatia, destroying towns, crushing lives and twisting the land that has molded 
Link's childhood.

Link embarks on a quest to save his homeland, exploring the early past and a very 
altered future, in an effort to locate the Mistress of Evil who would bend time 
toward Ganon's will.  Along the way, Link must bring together the three 
Flames of Calatia that can oppose her awesome power.  He must also seek
the seven fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom which the sorceress has hidden
throughout the land.  Even as Link confronts the many secrets of Calatia, 
history's course is set to overwrite his destiny.
