December 31st, 2002 - Today I'm posting the first submitted graphics for the Zelda3C Graphics Contest.  Special thanks goes to Az wazere for contributing an orc version of the cyclops bomber, Hinox!  Az will likely get his monster in the game, making him one of the contest winners.  [Edit: A more original monster has since replaced the orc.]

December 3rd, 2002 - I've been <i>making</i> time lately, whether I have it or not, to work on this game regularly.  I just finished moving to a new apartment, but I've still been able to get more done.  Most of this has been continued preparation, so that when I start announcing completed outdoors and dungeons, they won't be delayed by unforseen difficutlies.  I will know where I'm going as I design each planned area, and the world of Calatia will be built at a steady pace.
<br><br>

What can I describe that's not a spoiler??  LOL..  Well, most of the time has been spent playing with the ROM and with Hyrule Magic, learning how even more things work in both.  For example, I didn't know that the huge wall that slides west in the Desert Palace is actually an object I can put anywhere -- I thought it was hardcoded and had to stay right where it is!  I'm also getting deep into understanding the different doors available.  A lot of them look the same, but they really are different!
<br><br>

A few weeks ago, I wrote a program that puts in all the markup tags in the game's monologue for me, so all I have to do is write what people should say, push a button, and then copy the formatted text back into Hyrule Magic.  When you're working with a game this big (in comparison to Zelda 1, hehe), you have to automate all you can!
<br><br>

I know even more about how I can shape the story, in terms of events that occur and items collected.  I'm doing all I can to break the mold on the old game's timeline & itinerary. <br><br>

Overall, I've continued studying the ROM, and I've found even more ways to surprise people. My plans are much more organized now -- I now have a series of Excel files and folders that make up a design document, including a notebook full of drawings that (obviously) couldn't be typed up.  It's linked to my planning files for quick reference and includes puzzles, graphics artwork, overworld layouts, room layouts, mazes, and more.  Everything's coming together so well, I get giddy just thinking about it!

October 23rd, 2002 - What about July, August, and September??  That's correct, it's been four months since I've done anything significant with Zelda 3 Challenge.  With such a lapse, you would think the project is dead, wouldn't you?  Well, it is.  I don't like Zelda games anymore.  HA!  Just kidding!!!  Zelda 3 is still my absolute favorite SNES game of all time!  The project may have been postponed, but it's still very much alive.  
<a href="oct23.html">Here's where I went astray...</a>

June 24th, 2002 - Every last block, EA7 of EA7, is registered now.  It took a long time to get familiar with 3751 blocks!!  Now I can find the blocks I need with ease; creating the overworld will be fast and easy now.  Expect to see screen shots of the first town soon.  My other area of focus will be on overworld graphics and sprite graphics -- a new look to match a new world...
<br><br>

<img src="mini-tree.gif">
June 10th, 2002 - All blocks from Skull Forest, Dark Death Mountain, and screens immediately west of the Dark World's graveyard are registered.  I'm currently at block 9B4 of EA7.  That's 2484 out of 3751.
<br><br>

<img src="mini-tree.gif">
June 8th, 2002 - I have registered all Light World blocks as well as most Skull Forest blocks.  I now have over half of the blocks registered into the system.   
<br><br>

<img src="mini-tree.gif">
June 2nd, 2002 - Recently, I have been documenting all of the 16x16 overworld blocks which construct the 32x32 building blocks of Hyrule.  By doing so, I will be able to use my own 16x16 search engine to list elements to search for in Hyrule Magic's 32x32 search engine.  This will greatly speed up the process of designing the brand new overworld of Calatia.  Once this huge task is completed, I'll start creating new areas and posting new screen shots!
