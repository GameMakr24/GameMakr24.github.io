        The Thunderbird, a horrible guardian encountered 
		by Link in the Great Palace of 
        <font color="#008000"><b>Zelda 2</b></font>,
        has somehow survived and is out for revenge. Having lost
        the Triforce of Courage at the hands of its adversary, it
        has stolen the Triforce of Power and flown to the vast
        neighbor of Hyrule, the Outlands. In a world similar to
        yet completely different from 
        <font color="#008000"><b>Zelda 1</b></font>,
		Link must track down the captured Tetrarch
        Fairies and, with their help, break open Ganon's secret
        golden vault where the creature now resides.
		<br><br>

        Link will face dangers and traps unlike anything Ganon
        had ever devised. His adventure will span 18 new dungeons
        hidden within a completely unfamiliar terrain. Zelda
        herself will make appearances to help the hero, providing
        items and sage advice crucial to the new journey. Link
        has become very skilled in his familiar world of Hyrule,
        but skill alone is his only advantage -- the land of the
        Outlands is a beautiful yet deadly world bearing no
        resemblence to his own cherished kingdom.<br><br>

        <a name="over"><p align="left"><b>The Overworld</b><br><br></a>

        The old world map has been completely overwritten by the
        new one. You are guaranteed not to recognize <i>any</i>
        locations from the previous game. You'll even start your
        quest on the west side of the game, instead of the south!
        The color selections of each screen are new, meaning that
        what was once brown could now be green or grey, or even
        red if you travel deep enough into the world. The places
        where screens are re-used have changed, such as where you
        use a stepladder to reach a heart, and fairy ponds.</p>

        src="icymaze.gif" alt="Ice maze entrance." width="256" height="224"></p>
</center>
        <p align="left">The locations of
        secrets, such as dungeon entrances, shops, and residents
        with clues are changed. Thought you knew which screen to
        find Level 1 on? Think again! Even the 4 shortcuts (found
        by pushing rocks) are in new places! And when Link exits
        these caves and structures, he doesn't just pop out onto
        the places where the old caves used to be. New exit
        coordinates have been set to reflect the new passages.</p>

        alt="Best to stay indoors." width="256" height="224"> </p>
</center>
        <p align="left">Secrets are now
        locked according to what quest you're playing. For example,
        the rock you push to find a dungeon won't move on the
        second quest, so you have to find a new entrance
        somewhere else in the world. The game allows each secret
        to be set to 1st Quest, 2nd Quest, both, or neither. So,
        many places where you can bomb, burn, push things and use the
        recorder are quest-specific.</p>

</center>
        <p align="left">The &quot;waves&quot;
        sound effect has been moved to a new beach on the
        opposite side of the overworld. Each of the shops sell
        new combinations of items, including the bow and the
        white sword. The prices of all items have also been
        changed.</p>

</center>
        <p align="left">The monsters are
        distributed differently now, sometimes even with new
        graphics to trick the player. You might find red bats
        that cannot be hurt unless they stop moving, because
        they're really those flying flower creatures. There are
        new places to find fairies, though a few of the ponds are
        far from convenient to visit. The monsters may simply
        appear (poof!) or walk in from the sides, depending on
        the new terrain. Most of the monsters have new graphics
        (including all bosses) and some even have new colors. </p>

</center>
        <p align="left">The screens where you
        can wake up a statue to reveal a stairway have been
        changed, as have the locations where the recorder can
        open passages. And whenever the recorder doesn't open
        passages, magic dust (like Zelda 64) will wisk you to a
        different location. The stepladder can be used in new
        places, and not on the screens where you used to use it.</p>

        <a name="under"><p align="left"><b>The Underworld</b><br><br>
        </p></a>

        <p align="left">There are 42 possible
        block, water &amp; statue arrangements for the many
        dungeon rooms, and all but 3 are brand new. Examples of
        the old &quot;rooms&quot; include the entrance with the
        many statues, one with a horizontal river across the top
        half, boss rooms, the Triforce room, and many others. The
        usage of all these rooms in dungeons is also different.
        </p>

        <img src="blocks4.gif"

        src="blocks12.gif"
        alt="Definitely 'down under'.." width="256" height="224">
        </p>
</center>
        <p align="left">The other aspect of
        designing new dungeons lies with the four directions of
        each room. It's possible to control which are always
        open, which slam shut when you enter, which are locked,
        which can be bombed open, which are false walls, which
        are false walls that play a tune when you pass through
        them, and which are real walls. As for the gates that
        shut behind you, sometimes they will open again when the
        monsters are all defeated, and sometimes by some other
        means. And then there are gates that close behind you and
        never open again, which are great for one-way passages.</p>

        src="blocks15.gif" alt="A use for the key." width="256" height="224"> </p>
</center>
        <p align="left">Each dungeon has its
        own new color scheme. The new palettes give the underworld an
		entirely new atmosphere... Even some of the monsters (including
        bosses) have new colors.</p>

        src="blocks25.gif" alt="A flooded chamber." width="256" height="224"> </p>
</center>
        <p align="left">The game allows for
        any item to show up in any dungeon room. Will there be
        bombs, or 5 rupees, or a heart container? The items are
        distributed in a totally new manner.</p>

        <p align="left">In ZeldaC, the old man
        has been replaced by Zelda; now she will be the one giving
        you advice in dungeons, as well as occasional items! Just
        don't hit her or she <i>will</i> shoot back! And no, you
        won't be rescuing <i>her</i> in the last dungeon...</p>

        alt="No longer empty-handed..." width="256" height="224">
        </p>
</center>
        <p align="left">Each of the dungeons
        in ZeldaC has a map that can be displayed in the upper
        left corner of the screen. No matter the shape or
        appearance of the underworld maze, the map represents it
        accurately (except for certain hidden rooms). 
		Just like in the original game, Link is
        able to draw out the parts of the labyrinth he has
        actually visited, without data from the original game's
        maps interfering. If the compass is found, it will point
        out exactly where the captive Tetrarch fairy is with
        respect to Link's position. </p>

</center>
        <p align="left">Stairs can be pointed
        to other stairs, or to side-view item rooms, and can be associated
        with any of the regular dungeon rooms. The items in the
        item rooms can be changed to different items, and items
        can even be placed in tunnel rooms! Also, it's possible
        to control exactly where Link appears in any given room
        after exiting a side-view room. </p>

        <p>This version is the same as the "first and final"
		release, except with necessary changes made to it.  
		A list of bugs fixed is included.<br>
        <br>
        The reason there are &quot;options&quot; at all is
        because I've designed a complete instruction booklet to
        go with the game. It includes a story with pictures,
        hints and tips, a sketched map of the overworld, and even
        some critical information regarding situations not found
        in the original game. <br>
        <br>
        This game manual is written in html, with screen shots,
        icons, and more. It's really user-friendly, and you don't
        even have to be online to use it. Just unzip the contents
        of &quot;manual.zip&quot; to a folder on your computer,
        and then double-click index.htm. Chances are, you'll be
        impressed! :) <br>
        <br>
        Due to its larger size, I've made the manual optional.
        Keep in mind that it's the only real &quot;readme&quot;
        for the game now, and that it's cool and very helpful. <br>
