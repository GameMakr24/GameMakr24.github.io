To rename or create a page edited by Word, you cannot rename nor copy the html file!
Renaming causes the corresponding folder to be orphaned.
Copying to same folder is prevented.  Copying to alternate folder copies the corresponding folder as well.

The correct method is to open the file in Word and then Save-As to create a new html file.
