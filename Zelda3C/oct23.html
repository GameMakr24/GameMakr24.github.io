<h2>October 23, 2002</h2>

Soon after I finished registering ALL THOSE BLOCKS (pending trademark), my wife generously gave the 'okay' for me to get DSL.  And let me tell you, an incredibly fast, constant, reliable internet connection is very addicting.  Once connected, you may find yourself downloading everything you can, always grabbing more, more, MORE!  I got hooked on anime, and I've spent most of this time downloading and watching various Japanese TV series and movies. Inu Yasha, Love Hina, Maison Ikkoku, Maze, Magic Knights Rayearth, Neon Genesis Evangellion, Ranma 1/2, Rockman EXE, Rurouni Kenshin, Slayers, Tenchi Muyo, Urusei Yatsura, just to name a dozen in alphabetical order.  It's Vagla's fault, really!  Alright, so I can only pin NGE and Rockman on him.  LOL  But he condoned it!  (just kidding, Mr. V)  And this isn't counting the vast MP3 collection I now have, nor several cartoon series.  ::tempted to stop writing and go watch another episode of Zelda::
<br><br>

As you can imagine, all this downloading requires time to burn to CD, and a LOT of time to actually watch.  I have way more videos than I've actually had time for, so far, and I'm not rushing through them.  The rabid downloading has to stop somewhere, and it's winding down a lot lately.  Usenet takes too much time to keep up with, and I'm cutting back on KaZaA.  So I'm earning back a lot of my free time.  Lately, I'm learning to program in Windows & DirectX, using C++, because I'm planning to write a 2D/3D RPG with a friend.  But that's in the distant future, and it's school / career related.
<br><br>

I needed a long break from emulation & hacking (don't we all, at some point?) and now I've taken it.  Just yesterday I found myself creating a dungeon floorplan involving a button that won't stay down, a statue that can hold it down, and a lot of blue & orange pegs between them that must be manipulated to get the statue to the button.  Usually when the ideas start flowing, they keep flowing, and I get washed back into the project.  I can hear the floodgates creaking open already...  But you know what provides equal motivation?  Letters!  Email from fans saying they can't wait to play the new adventure, people that check this page regularly, watching for progress, screaming if they don't get regular news.  Well maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea.  Knowing people everywhere are anxious to play a SNES game on par with ZeldaC is what gives me drive, and that's really how I got all the way through making ZeldaC during its final stages.  I know there's a fanbase, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded.  :)
<br><br>

The next plan of action is to create part of the overworld, before I jump headfirst into the indoors and dungeons.  Don't worry about this project actually being terminated -- I've come too far already to just move on, and I have a lot of great things planned that simply must come about.  It's a huge project, bigger and harder to pull off than ZeldaC, but it's very much worth the effort and time.<br><br>
